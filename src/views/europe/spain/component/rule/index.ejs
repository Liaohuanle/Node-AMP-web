3. WINNERS: Winner of the Contest will be determined based on the following: There will be two rounds:
Round 1
    
Round 1 will last from the beginning of the Contest Period -- 12:00 a.m. GMT on April 20, 2018 until 11:59 p.m. GMT on April 27, 2018 (the “Round 1 Period”). During the Round 1 Period, Sponsor or its designees will select the best 400 Entries across all Categories according to the "creator score" ranking which will be calculated based on factors including video quality, engagement, creativity, and originality, as well as fit for the proposed theme. Sponsor reserves the right to select fewer than 400 winners if, in its sole discretion, the number or quality of Entries does not meet a minimum standard, to be determined by Sponsor. Round 1 Auditions will be scored by Sponsor or its designees. Each Entry selected by Sponsor or its designees as part of Round 1 to move on in the Contest is a “Round 1 Selection.”
Round 2
Following the Round 1 Period, each Round 1 Selection will be given a "creator score" which will be calculated based on factors including video quality, engagement, creativity, and originality, as well as fit for the proposed theme. The Round 2 Period will end at 11:59 p.m. GMT on May 3, 2018. Sponsor or its designees will select 100 winners based on a combination of Round 1 and Round 2 scoring. The 100 Round 2 Audition winners will each be a “Round 2 Winner.” Each Category winner from Round 2 will be a “Grand Prize Winner.”
Because this is a contest of skill, winning the Contest is dependent on the quality and number of submissions received. Sponsor or its designees will judge the quality and creativeness of Entries using algorithmic scoring to calculate the quality of Entrant’s performance during the Contest based on Entrants’ videos view number, engagements and other user interactive data.
